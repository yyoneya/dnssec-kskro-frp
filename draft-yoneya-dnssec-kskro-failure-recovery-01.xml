      <t>
	This document describes a set of common problems and possible
	recovery methods for DNSSEC when there is a DS published in
	the parent zone which does no longer match any DNSKEY in the
	child zone. As DNSSEC validators are becoming widely deployed,
	this will have serious effect on the availability of the zone,
	and the need for a quick recovery is needed.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        When a zone is signed and a DS has been published in the
	parent zone DNS name resolution will fail when DS in the
	parent zone and the DNSKEY in child zone become inconsistent.
	The impact of a DS mismatch will be much more severe when it
	occurs high up in the DNS hierarchy, such as for a TLD where
	it could make millions of child zones unresolvable.  IANA have
	a defined process for registering DS records for a TLD to the
	root zone <xref target="IANAPROC"/> and a validation procedure
	of registered DS <xref target="ROOTDNSSEC"/>, but there will
	still be a non-zero risk of human error.  Having a set of best
	practices for emergency countermeasures in the case of a KSK
	rollover failure will be helpful for a stable DNSSEC
	operation.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Examples of KSK rollover failures">
      <t>
	A DNS operator can cause the chain of trust between the parent
	and child to break in some different ways.  These are just
	some examples:

	The key storage for the main DNSSEC signer is broken (or even
	the whole machine).  The DNS operator in this case will have
	to restore the keys and the DNSSEC signer process to a normal
	state, and this can take some time - and in some cases it can
	be impossible to restore the system and the keys.
	
	The KSK rollover process misbehaves causing the zone to be
	signed with keys not matched by any DS record published in the
	parent zone.

	TODO: more examples?

    <section title="Consideration from observed incident">
      <t>
        On middle of 2012, there was KSK rollover failure at a famous
	site.  Followings are observed actions the site's zone master 
	took and consideration about them.
      </t>

      <section title="Action 1 (Act1): Add new KSK DNSKEY to the zone">
        <t>
	  The zone master added a new KSK DNSKEY to the zone.  At that
	  time, ZSK for the zone was signed with the new KSK, but was 
	  not double-signed with previous (current) KSK.  Therefore, 
	  consistency between DS in parent zone and DNSKEY in child
	  zone was broken.  By this action, the zone became bogus
	  (name resolution at validator became failure).
	</t>
	<t>
	  Following figure shows relation of DS and DNSKEY in parent
	  zone and child zone.
